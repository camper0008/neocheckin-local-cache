# this is an example of how settings.conf should look
# settings.conf should be in 'config/settings.conf', and when compiled should look like this
# 
# ROOT (working directory)
#   neocheckin_cache (executable)
#   config
#     settings.conf
# 
# you should be able to copy this file and rename it to settings.conf without issues.
# NOTE: reads from line 1 to line 2 until first comment
#   which means if you have a line called
# KEY=VALUE  # this is a value, 
# config["KEY"] will be "VALUE  "
